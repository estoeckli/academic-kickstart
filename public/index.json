Up to today little is known on the roles chatbots play in facilitating feedback exchange. However, digitization and automation put pressure on companies to setup digital work environments that enable reskilling of employees. Therefore, a structured analysis of feedback-related chatbots for Slack was conducted. Our results propose six archetypes that reveal the roles of chatbots in facilitating feedback exchange on performance, culture and ideas. We show that chatbots do not only consist of conversational agents integrated into instant messenger but are tightly linked to complementary front- end systems such as mobile and web apps. Like the upper part of an iceberg, the conversational agent is above water and visible within the chat, whereas many user interactions of feedback-related chatbots are only possible outside of the instant messenger. Further, we extract six design principles for chatbots as digital feedback systems. We do this by analyzing chatbots and linking empirically observed design features to (meta-)requirements derived from explanatory theory on feedback, self- determination and persuasive systems. The results suggest that chatbots benefit the social environment of conversation agents and the richness of the graphical user interface of external applications.","tags":null,"title":"Looking Beneath the Tip of the Iceberg: The Two-Sided Nature of Chatbots and Their Roles for Digital Feedback Exchange","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roman Rietsche","Daniel Frei","Emanuel Stoeckli","Matthias Soellner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546329600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546329600,"objectID":"3eb49a398f7eb59c2d24430c64f5d5ac","permalink":"/publication/rietsche-2019-do/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/rietsche-2019-do/","section":"publication","summary":"The amount of online reviews is growing significantly.

Hence, plethora of scholars have investigated the role of online reviews and researched factors and characteristics deter- mining its helpfulness. Nevertheless, mixed findings were found. Consequently, the purpose of our paper is to present a holistic and representative analysis of the literature on factors indicating the helpfulness of online reviews. In total, we analyzed 81 journal articles and inductively created a framework resulting in four dimensions: review-related factors, reviewer-related factors, reader related factors and envi- ronment-related factors.

This research investigates a feedback app in a naturalistic context within a globally leading financial service corporation (InsurCorp).

Rich contextual insights from a multinational pilot study with 568 users are gained by triangulating qualitative data from 21 semi-structured interviews and 69 feedback app user reviews with usage data. Anchored in the theory of affordances, we provide insights on use practices and find that the app affords operational-level feedback exchange on specific subjects, while general feedback on sensitive topics is preferably exchanged in person. To understand actualization facilitators and barriers, we take a social-technical systems perspective to elaborate contextual factors that influence the individual’s actualization decision.","tags":["Performance Feedback","Feedback App","Digital Work","Digitalization","Affordance Theory","Insurance Industry"],"title":"Digital Feedback for Digital Work?

Hence, it is relevant to assess the possibilities for goal-oriented action they offer and spot the differences among them.

Our model, which we dubbed CostHat, supports both, Microservices deployed on traditional IaaS or PaaS clouds, and services that make use of novel cloud programming paradigms, such as AWS Lambda. CostHat is based on a network model, and allows for what-if and cost sensitivity analysis. Further, we have used this model to implement tooling that warns cloud developers directly in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) about certain classes of potentially costly code changes. We illustrate our work based on a case study, and evaluate the CostHat model using a standalone Python implementation. We show that, once instantiated, cost calculation in CostHat is computationally inexpensive on standard hardware (below 1 ms even for applications consisting of thousand services and endpoints). This enables its use in real-time for developer tooling which continually re-evaluates the costs of an application in the background, while the developer is working on the code.","tags":["Cloud Computing","Cost Predictions","Serverless","Microservices","Integrated-Development Environment"],"title":"Modelling and Managing Deployment Costs of Microservice-based Cloud Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emanuel Stoeckli","Falk Uebernickel","Walter Brenner"],"categories":null,"content":" Characteristics of Insurance Digitalization Efforts ","date":1454313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454313600,"objectID":"3135ff33ad6aa965ce695adc00b06a4e","permalink":"/publication/stoeckli-2016-tc/","publishdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/stoeckli-2016-tc/","section":"publication","summary":"Today, digitalization is already far progressed. Both, digitized and purely digital products and services are omnipresent. A myriad of promising opportunities are arising and corporates in many industries are challenged to transform their strategies, operations and IT for successful exploitation. Although the insurance industry is said to lag behind other sectors in terms of digitalization, insurance products and services are per se virtual. Hence, digitalization is starting beyond pure product digitization, affecting the whole insurance value chain. However, the ubiquitous and ambiguous nature of digitalization makes it hard to grasp the phenomenon as a such. This has led to a plethora of buzzwords. Therefore, the purpose of the paper at hand is to shed light on what the phenomenon of digitalization means for insurance companies. Primary data collection for this report is twofold. First, our insights are grounded in a multiple-case study with a broad range of insurance employees from four DACH companies. Second, we have collected publicly available digitalization efforts related and specific to the insurance industry. Thereby our focus was on new market entrants, i.e., startups. However, we also considered digitalization efforts of forward-looking traditional insurers that were mentioned in our interviews. In total, we collected 192 digitalization efforts. Our findings unveil major themes and decisions that matter to insurance companies at a strategic, operational and socio-technical level. With the blurring industry boundaries, insurances need to decide on their intended ecosystem positioning and on the degree of self-service they want to offer to their customers. The latter requires an assessment of how self-reliant they expect their target customers to be in future. On the operational level, insurances need to exploit the newly available data, both internal and external, to improve their processes along the entire value chain. Also, a major theme is to streamline digital customer interactions. Furthermore, our insights reveal eight socio-technical challenges that need to be approached by insurers. This includes the (1) employee-orientation and context sensitivity of enterprise applications, (2) the integration of social software into operations, (3) the management of both, internal and external data, (4) the application of new perspectives on make-or-buy decisions, (5) the enrichment of workplaces with sensor technology, (6) the need to increase flexibility and scalability of IT architectures, (7) the exploitation of analytics and (8) the digitization, transformation and mining of information and process flows. With this contribution, the report at hand provides valuable input for practitioners to reflect on their endeavors to tackle the digital transformation. Furthermore, the themes and decisions suggested in this report can serve as a basis to explore and assess digitalization efforts.","tags":["Digitalization","Digital Transformation","Insurance Industry"],"title":"Digitalization in the Insurance Industry.
